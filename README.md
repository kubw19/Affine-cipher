# Affine cipher
This is a simple implementation of affine cipher. 
To change alphabet you have to set it in main.cpp and compile again. 
After executing the program it asks you for **A** and **B** parameter. 
Be advised that i haven't implemented function to check if **A** is coprime with **N** where **N** is size of the given alphabet;
